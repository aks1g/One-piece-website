            <p><b>Role:</b> Captain of the Straw Hat Pirates<br>

            <b>Age:</b> 19<br>
            
            <b>Height:</b> 174 cm (5'8½")<br>
            
            <b>Bounty:</b> 1,500,000,000 Berries <br>
            
            <b>Devil Fruit:</b> Gomu Gomu no Mi (Gum-Gum Fruit) <br>
            <h3 class="md-heading"><b>Abilities:</b></h3>

            <p><b>Gomu no Mi: </b><br>
                 This Paramecia-type Devil Fruit grants Luffy's body the properties of rubber, allowing him to stretch, inflate, and bounce. His body is highly resistant to blunt force attacks, and he can use his elasticity to perform powerful techniques. <br>
            <b> Haki:</b><br> Luffy has mastered all three types of Haki: <br>
            <b>Kenbunshoku Haki (Observation Haki):</b> Enhances his senses and allows him to predict opponents' moves. <br>
            <b>Busoshoku Haki (Armament Haki):</b> Coats his body or attacks with a protective layer, making his attacks more potent and able to bypass Devil Fruit defenses. <br>
            <b>Haoshoku Haki (Conqueror's Haki):</b> A rare form of Haki that allows him to exert his willpower to overpower the will of others, often causing weaker-willed opponents to faint.</p>
            <h3 class="md-heading"><b>Background:</b><br></h3>
            <p>Luffy was born in Foosha Village and grew up idolizing the pirate Shanks. After eating the Gomu Gomu no Mi, he gained the powers of rubber but lost the ability to swim. Inspired by Shanks and driven by his dream to find the legendary treasure One Piece, Luffy set out to sea to become the Pirate King. Over his journey, he has gathered a diverse and powerful crew known as the Straw Hat Pirates.</p>
            <h3 class="md-heading"><b>Quotes:</b></h3><br>
            <ul>
                <li> "I'm gonna be King of the Pirates!" </li>
                <li> "If you dont take risks, you cant create a future." </li>
                <li> "I dont want to conquer anything. I just think the guy with the most freedom in this whole ocean… is the Pirate King!"</li>
